## Description

The numerical experiments reported in the paper were conducted using RAPOSa 3.0.1 on Ubuntu 22.04.  
The RAPOSa executable is available in the `scripts` folder. More information can be found at [https://raposa.usc.es](https://raposa.usc.es).

The test instances used in the paper are included in the `data/instances` folder. This includes `.nl` files from the three libraries analyzed in the study: **DS**, **MINLPLib**, and **QPLIB**.

To run RAPOSa on a given instance, use:

```raposa problem.nl```

As the reported results include computational times, exact replication is not feasible. However, the qualitative behavior can be reproduced.  

To approximate the results in the paper, use the following command:

```raposa problem.nl -linsolver=gurobi -bt=FXOX -ws=0 -branchingrule=RULE```


Replace `RULE` with the appropriate branching strategy:

- **Dual**: `sum_dual_weighted_plus1`
- **Range**: `sum_rescaled_var_range_weighted`
- **Eigen**: `eigen_cen_alternative`
- **Dual rel.**: `sum_dual_weighted_plus1 -relbranching=161`
- **Range rel.**: `sum_rescaled_var_range_weighted -relbranching=161`
- **Eigen rel.**: `eigen_cen_alternative -relbranching=161`
- **Best rule**: `best`
- **Best variable**: `best_variable`

## Results

### Raw Results

The directory `results` contains all raw output files generated by RAPOSa during the experiments, without any post-processing.

### Processed Results

The tables and performance profiles shown in the paper were generated using a custom Ruby on Rails-based internal platform with a graphical interface. Therefore, we cannot include the exact post-processing scripts in this repository. 

However, the methodology to generate these results is fully described in the paper and can be reproduced accordingly.
